# Business Recommendation: 
1. Reduce Driver-Initiated Cancellations:
* **Issue**: High rate of driver cancellations reduces platform efficiency and customer trust
* **Recommendation**: Have strict penalties/warning for frequent cancellations, or incentivize drivers who consistenly accept or complete rides.
* **Impact**: Decrease cancellation rate and boost Uber's revenue

2. Optimize Customer Wait Times
* **Issue**: Cancellations spike when wat time ~12.5 minutes
* **Recommendation**: Provide driver time reminders or alert to reach customer within 10 minutes, or automatically send customer message that drivers are coming as soon as posisble
* **Impact**: Reduce the cancellation rate and boost Uber's revenue

3. Review Vehicle Type
* **Issue**: UberXL shows negligible contribution to revenue
* **Recommendation**: Consider reallocate resources to higher demanding vehicles
* **Impact**: Optimize resource

4. Prevent Incomplete Ride
* **Issue**: Many customers stop around 10km
* **Recommendation**: Add an app reminder/notification (for example: 'You are half way there'), or some offers when they finish the rides (for example: 2% cash back, Uber tokens)
* **Impact**: Increase Ride Completition and boost Uber's revenue

6. Strengthen Customer Loyalty
* **Issue**: The highest number of booking by Customer was 3
* **Recommendation**: Introduce more offers for coming back customers, send notification about events might happen hours later/day later to seek customer's attention
